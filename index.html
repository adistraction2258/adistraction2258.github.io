    <h2> Why choose Joe Schmo?</h2>
    <p1> Earlier this year, our english teacher was running through her presentation and said, "Don't trust Joe Schmo at JoeSchmo.com, they aren't reliable." Well, my friends and I have decided to challenge this idea. We did vigorus research on all of the Joe Schmos she was offending, and found out there are many common people named Joe Schmo. Here, we will list some of the many we have found out to be very reliable.</p1>
